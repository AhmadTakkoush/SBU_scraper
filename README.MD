# SBU Search Scraper

## SBUHacks
 SBUHacks is a 24 hour hackathon with endless creativity. Students are challenged to further what they know by creating projects following their passions. Spending time on projects outside the classroom is the best way to not only learn what you love, but also find new interests. In a universe of infinite possibilities, you have 24 hours to innovate and show us what you got! 

## What is it?

  SBU_scraper.py is a script written in python that automates going through the Stony Brook University website and searches for the term "Computer Science" and returns all the headlines followed by the links concerning that search.
  
## Why?
  I wanted to challenge myself and learn something new within a limited time frame, I've had an interest in python for a while & I thought I'd do a simple script just to see what python is capable of.

### How to run?
Follow the steps to run the script:
* Download Selenium webdriver. [Chrome](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads), [Firefox](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)
* Extract the driver in a preffered location
* Make sure you have python3 installed.
* Change the `PATH` location in `SBU_scraper.py` to the location of your webdriver.
* Run the script in your favorite IDE. I used [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
